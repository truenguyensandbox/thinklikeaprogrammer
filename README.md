# Think Like a Programmer

Welcome to **Think Like a Programmer**! This web application is designed to teach beginners the basics of programming using interactive lessons and real code examples. The app includes a variety of topics such as variables, loops, functions, objects, events, conditionals, and more!

## Features

- **Interactive Lessons**: Each lesson provides a brief explanation followed by an interactive example.
- **Code Examples**: Show and hide real code examples with a click of a button.
- **Mark Lessons as Complete**: Users can mark lessons as complete with a button.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adjusts for desktop and mobile devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Smooth scrolling for navigating through lessons.
- **Footer with Links**: Includes direct links to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/nguyentm99) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

## Lessons Included

- **Variables**: Learn about variables and how to store data.
- **Loops**: Understand how loops are used to repeat actions.
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code that perform tasks.
- **Arrays**: Storing multiple values in one variable.
- **Objects**: Grouping data and functions together.
- **Events**: Trigger actions based on user interactions.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in your code with `if/else`.
- **Boolean Logic**: Using true/false values and logical operators.
- **Data Types**: Understanding strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.
- **Debugging**: Learning how to spot and fix errors in your code.
- **Code Comments**: Adding comments to explain your code.
- **Operators**: Using arithmetic and comparison operators.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For structure and content.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, such as toggling examples, marking lessons as complete, and smooth scrolling.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
